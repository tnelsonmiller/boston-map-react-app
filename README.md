## Boston Theatre District Map

## Overview

This project was completed for project 7 (Neighborhood Maps Project) for Udacity's Front End Nano-Degree program. This project uses React and two APIs along with the following dependencies:
* Google Maps
* FourSquare
* Font Awesome
* React Material-UI for Drawer
* Google-maps-react for map display

## Features

This application displays my favorite theatres in Boston, MA Theatre District. The location for each theatre is indicated on the Google map with a marker. When the marker is clicked it bounces and opens an info window with the name of the venue, a link to the theatre's website, and an image of the theatre from FourSquare. Click the close button to select another location. Click on the hamburger icon to display a list of all locations. Use the search box to enter the name of the venue. The list is updated with the venue names that match the search criteria. Click the venue name to display the location on the map.
